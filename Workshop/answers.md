### Q.13 Describe the principle of Arc welding. Also explain MIG welding and its application with the help of neat sketch.  
**(15 marks)**  
- **Introduction / Arc Welding Principle (3m):**  
  - **Arc Welding Principle:** Uses an electric arc between an electrode and the base metal to melt and fuse materials. The arc generates high heat (3000–20,000°C). Ionization of gas in the gap sustains the arc. Molten pool created; on cooling, forms weld joint. Often uses shielding (gas or flux) to protect molten metal from atmospheric contamination.  
  - **Types of arc welding:** SMAW (stick), GMAW (MIG/MAG), GTAW (TIG), SAW (submerged arc), etc.  
- **Sketch for Principle (brief):**  
  - Simple diagram: electrode tip, arc region, molten weld pool, base metal; indicate power source.  
- **MIG Welding (Metal Inert Gas) / GMAW (3–4m):**  
  - **Definition / Principle:** MIG welding is Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) where a continuous consumable wire electrode is fed from a spool through the welding gun; an inert shielding gas (e.g., Argon or Argon + CO₂ mix depending on metal) flows around the wire to protect the arc and molten metal. The arc forms between wire tip and workpiece; molten metal transfers from wire to the weld pool.  
  - **Equipment and Components (sketch):**  
    - **Power source:** Constant voltage (CV) DC power supply.  
    - **Wire feed unit:** Feeds electrode wire continuously at set feed rate.  
    - **Welding gun / torch:** Delivers wire and shielding gas.  
    - **Shielding gas supply:** Cylinder of inert or semi-inert gas (Argon, Argon+CO₂).  
    - **Ground clamp:** Completes circuit.  
    - Sketch: show wire spool, feed motor, gun, nozzle, gas flow, arc, weld pool.  
  - **Working parameters:**  
    - **Voltage and current:** CV machine maintains voltage; current depends on wire feed speed.  
    - **Wire type and diameter:** Selected per base metal; e.g., mild steel wire for steel welding; aluminium wire for aluminium (requires different gas).  
    - **Shielding gas:** For steel: CO₂ or Ar+CO₂ mix; for stainless: Ar+O₂ or Ar+CO₂; for aluminium: pure Argon.  
    - **Polarity:** Usually DCEN (Direct Current Electrode Negative) or DCEP depending on process.  
    - **Travel speed, torch angle:** Influences bead shape and penetration.  
  - **Advantages of MIG welding (1m):**  
    - High deposition rate, continuous welding (no frequent electrode change), ease of automation, cleaner welds (less slag), easy operator training, suitable for thin to medium thickness.  
    - Good for welding non-ferrous metals (with correct gas).  
  - **Limitations (0.5m):**  
    - Requires shielding gas supply (less portable), sensitive to wind drafts outdoors, equipment cost higher, need clean surfaces.  
  - **Applications (0.5m):**  
    - Automotive industry (body panels, frames), fabrication, structural welding, manufacturing of pressure vessels, shipbuilding (indoors), piping, furniture, etc.  
  - **Safety considerations (brief) (0.5m):**  
    - Protect against UV radiation, fumes (ventilation), wear PPE, avoid gas leaks.  
- **Conclusion (1m):**  
  - MIG welding is a widely used arc welding variant offering high productivity and good quality welds. Suitable for various metals when proper parameters and shielding gases are selected. Emphasize importance of neat sketch showing wire feed, shielding gas, arc, weld pool.
